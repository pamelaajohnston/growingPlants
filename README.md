# growingPlants
A repository to analyse images of growing plants


Use this dataset [Aberystwyth Leaf Evaluation](https://zenodo.org/record/168158#.YnjqRS8w2qB)
Which I got from [quantitative plant](https://www.quantitative-plant.org/dataset/leaf-annotation) which is a collection of datasets to do with plants.The Aberystwyth Leave

Aim is to get a measure of the "leafiness" of the images.
Start with just a simple colour-based filter.

The initial tests were done on [this timelapse youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsS91x5StQ)


Which was extracted [to png files using ffmpeg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40088222/ffmpeg-convert-video-to-images)
And then any frame with green writing was removed (manually)
