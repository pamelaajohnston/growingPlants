# growingPlants
A repository to analyse images of growing plants


Used this dataset [Aberystwyth Leaf Evaluation](https://zenodo.org/record/168158#.YnjqRS8w2qB)
Which I got from [quantitative plant](https://www.quantitative-plant.org/dataset/leaf-annotation) which is a collection of datasets to do with plants.

Aim is to get a measure of the "leafiness" of the images.
Start with just a simple colour-based filter.
